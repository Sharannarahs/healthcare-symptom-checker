## Backend Details

The backend is built using **Node.js** and **Express**, handling API requests, LLM integration, and database storage.

### server.js
- Entry point of the backend application.
- Sets up the Express server, middleware, and routes.
- Routes included:
  - `/api/status` â†’ simple health check endpoint.
  - `/api/symptom-check` â†’ accepts symptom text from the user and returns AI analysis.
  - `/api/history` â†’ fetches all chat history.
- Uses `cors` and `express.json()` for handling requests.
- Environment variables are loaded via `.env`.

### db.js
- Handles **MySQL database connection** using `mysql2`.
- Configures a connection pool for efficient queries.
- Connects to the `healthcare_db` database.
- Exports a promise-based interface for async database queries.

### routes/chat.js
- Contains **API routes** for chat operations:
  1. `GET /history` â†’ fetch all previous chats from the database.
  2. `DELETE /history/:id` â†’ delete a chat entry by ID.
  3. `POST /symptom-check` â†’ send user symptoms to the LLM and save AI output to the database.

- Handles errors gracefully and responds with appropriate HTTP status codes.

### gemini/geminiClient.js
- Integrates with **Google Gemini API** (LLM) for AI symptom analysis.
- Exports `getSymptomAnalysis(symptoms)` function:
  - Sends a **carefully crafted prompt** to the LLM including instructions to:
    - Suggest 3â€“5 probable health conditions.
    - Provide recommended next steps (self-care, monitoring, urgent care advice).
    - Include a mandatory educational disclaimer.
  - Returns structured text output from the LLM.
- Uses `GoogleGenerativeAI` SDK and `gemini-2.5-flash-lite` model.

### Key Functions:
- `getSymptomAnalysis(symptoms)` â†’ Sends symptom text to LLM and receives structured output.
- Database queries in `chat.js`:
  - `INSERT INTO chat_history (user_query, ai_response)` â†’ stores new queries.
  - `SELECT * FROM chat_history ORDER BY id DESC` â†’ fetches chat history.
  - `DELETE FROM chat_history WHERE id = ?` â†’ deletes a chat entry.

## Frontend Details

### App.jsx

This is the main React component that handles the **chat interface**, **user input**, **AI responses**, and the **chat history sidebar**.  

**Key Features:**

1. **Chat Interface:**
   - Displays user and AI messages in a conversational format.
   - AI messages are structured into:
     - **Probable Conditions**
     - **Recommended Next Steps**
   - Styled using Tailwind CSS for clarity and readability.
   - Chat messages dynamically scroll to the latest message using `useRef`.

2. **Input Box for Symptoms:**
   - Multi-line textarea for users to type their symptoms.
   - Submits input to the backend API `/api/symptom-check`.
   - Disabled while AI response is loading to prevent multiple submissions.

3. **Sidebar for Chat History:**
   - Opens from the right using a toggle button.
   - Fetches **chat history** from the backend `/api/history`.
   - Displays a **truncated preview** (first 70 characters) of AI responses.
   - Clicking a history entry opens the **full AI response** in the chat window.
   - Each entry has a **delete button** to remove it from the database.

4. **Loading & Error Handling:**
   - Shows `Analyzing...` while backend is processing the request.
   - Alerts the user if the request fails or thereâ€™s a server error.

### utils.js

Contains helper function `parseAIResponse(response)`:

- Splits AI response into **conditions** and **recommended steps**.
- Converts the raw text from LLM into structured JSON format.
- Used by App.jsx to render AI messages clearly in the frontend.
